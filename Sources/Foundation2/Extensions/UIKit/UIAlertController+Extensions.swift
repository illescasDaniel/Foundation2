	(Original description)
	
	Create and return an action with the specified title and behavior.
	Actions are enabled by default when you create them.
	
	- Parameters:
		- title: The text to use for the button title. The value you specify should be localized for the userâ€™s current language. This parameter must not be nil, except in a tvOS app where a nil title may be used with cancel.
		- style: Additional styling information to apply to the button. Use the style information to convey the type of action that is performed by the button. For a list of possible values, see the constants in UIAlertActionStyle.
		- handler: A block to execute when the user selects the action. This block has no return value and takes the selected action object as its only parameter.
	- Returns: A new alert action object.
	- SDKs:	iOS 8.0+, tvOS 9.0+
